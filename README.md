# DESCRIPTION

This module defines color names and their associated RGB values
from the online version of
[Werner's Nomenclature of Colors](https://www.c82.net/werner/).

Note that the color names have been normalized to lower case,
without and punctuation. However, they will use the original
spelling, e.g. "colour" instead of "color".
